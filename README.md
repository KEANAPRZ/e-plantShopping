# FINAL PROJECT for Developing Front-End Apps with React

# Paradise Nursery Shopping Application

## Final Project Overview

For this final project, I created the front-end of a **Paradise Nursery** shopping application. The application allows users to browse a variety of houseplants, add them to a shopping cart, and adjust quantities before checkout. This project was developed using **React** and **Redux** for state management, and **Vite** as the bundler.

### Application Features:

1. **Landing Page**:
   - Includes a **background image**, a **paragraph about the company**, the **company name**, and a **Get Started button** linking to the product page.

2. **Product Listing Page**:
   - Displays at least **six houseplants** for sale, organized into **three or more categories**.
   - Each plant includes the following details:
     - A **thumbnail image**
     - **Plant name**
     - **Price**
     - **An Add to Cart button**
   - The page also has a **header** with a **shopping cart icon** that dynamically updates to show the total number of items in the cart.

3. **Shopping Cart Page**:
   - Displays all the items added to the cart, including:
     - **Thumbnail** and **name** of each plant
     - **Unit price** and **total cost**
     - Buttons to **increase** or **decrease** the quantity of each plant
     - A **delete** button for removing an item
     - A **Continue Shopping button** and **Checkout button** with a message "Thank You for Checking Out" upon clicking.

### Technologies Used:
- **React** for building the user interface.
- **Redux** for managing the global state (cart items).
- **Vite** as the bundler.
- **GitHub Pages** for deployment.
